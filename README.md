## Process
- Get and download the data from datasource
- Looked through the data in libreoffice and formulated the question i wanted to answer from the data.  "What sort of questions were people asking the broadcast channel through time? How did these topics change?"
- Chose to work with python in jupyter notebook to do basic exploration of the data.   
While exploring, I realised that:  
              - The most important columns were the questions column and the day, month and year column.  
              - I could merge the day, month and year columns to a single column called date in order to establish a timeline.   
- Decided to do text summarization on the questions to get an idea of the topics (This took FOR EVER).   
- I  have to do a sort of clustering in order to get similar topics together.   
- Summarize the data and then Visualize with d3js.
